Ephemeris Models
################

.. class:: Approximate Planet Positions

   Highly simplified model of ephemerides of major Solar system bodies, with Keplerian elements modelled as linear functions of time, and several sinusoidal variations (full model described `here <https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/txt/aprx_pos_planets.pdf>`_). Both a three-dimensional, and circular coplanar approximation may be used.

   which allows one to add the ephemeris model of a planet, to any custom body. In the above example, the body ``CustomBody`` is endowed with the approximate ephemeris model of ``Jupiter``. 

.. class:: Direct Spice Ephemeris

   Ephemeris retrieved directly from the Spice toolbox (requires an appropriate Spice kernel to be loaded).

   This creates a barycentric (origin: SSB) ephemeris with axes along J2000, with data directly from spice.

             :language: cpp

   which allows one to add the ephemeris model of any body to any custom body. In the above example, the body ``CustomBody`` is endowed with the approximate ephemeris model of ``Jupiter``. 

.. class:: Interpolated Spice Ephemeris

   Using this option the state of the body is retrieved from Spice at regular intervals *during* the environment propagation (as opposed to during the propagation). These data are then used to create an interpolator, which is put into the environment, and called during the propagation. This has the advantage of only requiring calls to Spice outside of the propagation inner loop, reducing computation time in many cases (a single call to the interpolator is significantly faster that a single call to Spice). However, it has the downside of being applicable only during a limited time interval, and requiring the tabulated data to be stored in RAM.

  creating a barycentric (SSB) ephemeris with axes along J2000, with data retrieved from Spice at 3600 s intervals between t=0 and t=1.0E8. By default, a 6th order Lagrange interpolator is used (NOTE: the Lagrange interpolator is not reliable at the edges of the interpolation interval, as discussed :ref:`here<lagrange_interpolator_edges>`) Settings for an alternative interpolator can be use (see :ref:`interpolators<interpolator_settings>`) by specifying the optional input argument. Additionally, as is the case for the :class:`.Direct Spice Ephemeris`, an optional input argument ``body_name_to_use`` to use an ephemeris model from Spice for body A and assign it to body B.

  This creates a Kepler orbit as ephemeris using the given kepler elements (``initial_state_in_keplerian_elements`` numpy array, size 6, required order: :math:`a,e,i,\omega,\Omega,\theta`, with the final element the true anomaly). These are taken as the elements at the time ``initial_state_epoch`` and propagated to any other time using the provided ``central_body_gravitational_parameter``. See :ref:`Frame/State Transformations` for more details on orbital elements in Tudat.

.. class:: Kepler Ephemeris from Spice

  This ephemeris model is essentially a wrapper for the Kepler Ephemeris, with the added functionality that the initial Keplerian state is extracted from Spice, as opposed to provided manually

   where the ``custom_state_function`` must be a function pointer taking a float (time) as input, and returning a nunmpy array, size 6 (Cartesian state)

.. class:: Scaled Ephemeris

          .. literalinclude:: /_src_snippets/simulation/environment_setup/environment_models/scaled_ephemeris.cpp
             :language: cpp

In the above case, the original Jupiter ephemeris setting is taken, and each state element (x,y,z position and velocity) from the original ephemeris is multiplied by a factor 1.001 before being used in the simulation. Two additional interfaces exist:

* Taking a ``scaling_vector`` as input (numpy array, size 6) instead of ``scaling_constant``. With this interface, a different scaling constant can be applied for each entry of the Cartesian state.
* Taking a ``scaling_vector_function`` as input (function pointer taking a float as input, returning numpy array, size 6) instead of ``scaling_constant``. With this interface, a time-varying (float input to function pointer represents time) scaling constant can be applied for each entry of the Cartesian state.

Finally, an optional boolean input argument ``is_scaling_absolute`` (default false) can be provided to the ``environment_setup.ephemeris.scaled`` functions. Setting this boolean to true will *add*  the scaling value to the state, instead of the default behaviour of *multiplying*  the state by the scaling value.

  The ``associated_reference_frame`` must presently be the same frame ID as the target frame of the body’s rotation model (see below). It represents the frame in which the spherical harmonic field is defined. The ``normalized_cosine_coefficients`` and ``normalized_sine_coefficients`` are numpy two-dimensional arrays containing the spherical harmonic coefficients. As such, note that entry (0,0) of cosine coefficients should be equal to 1.

Time-variations of the Gravity Field
####################################

Unlike most other environment models, gravity field variations are provided as a *list* for a single body: multiple gravity field variation settings may be defined. Their summation is then applied to the spherical harmonic gravity field.

.. class:: Basic Solid Body Gravity Field Variation

  Variations of the gravity field due to solid body tides, using the model provide (for instance) by `Eq. 6.6 of this document <https://www.iers.org/SharedDocs/Publikationen/EN/IERS/Publications/tn/TechnNote36/tn36_079.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=1>`_). Several options, using various levels of simplification, can be used:

  where the ``cosine_variations_table``  and ``sine_variations_table`` variables contain the tabulated data for the variations of the spherical harmonic coefficients. Both are dictionaries (keys: floats representing time - values: numpy arrays, size :math:`N\times M`, representing variation in gravity field coefficients at given time). Each value in these two dictionaries must be the same size array. The ``minimum_degree`` and ``minimum_degree`` inputs define how the data in the table is processed: they denote the degree and order of the variation that the (0,0) entry in each value in the dictionaries represent. For instance, for array sizes :math:`N=2` and :math:`M=3`, the above would provide variations in gravity field at degree 2 and 3 (up to order 3)

.. class:: Exponential Atmosphere

  Simple atmosphere model independent of time, latitude and longitude based on an exponentially decaying density profile with a constant temperature and composition. 

  For example for an exponential atmosphere with a scale height of 7200 m, a constant temperature of 290 K, a density at 0 m altitude of 1.225 kg/m^3 and a specific gas constant of 287.06 J/(kg K):

  There are two options for providing the ``density_function``:
  
  * A function taking a single float (altitude) as input, with a single float (density) as output. 
  * A function taking four floats (altitude, latitude, longitude, time, *in that order*) as input, with a single float (density) as output. 

  The value of pressure is computed by assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, whereas temperature, gas constant and the ratio of specific heats are assumed to be constant.

  In the above case, the original Earth atmosphere setting is taken, and the density from the original model is multiplied by a factor 1.5 before being used in the simulation. An additional interfaces exist:

* Taking a ``scaling_function`` as input: a function pointer taking a float as input, representing the current time, returning a float which is the current scaling factor, instead of ``scaling_constant``. With this interface, a time-varying scaling constant can be applie to the density.

  Finally, an optional boolean input argument ``is_scaling_absolute`` (default false) can be provided to the ``environment_setup.atmosphere.scaled`` functions. Setting this boolean to true will *add*  the scaling value to the state, instead of the default behaviour of *multiplying*  the state by the scaling value.


  .. warning::

      At present, the scaled atmosphere model only supports scaling of the density value. For cases where the density is used to compute other atmospheric quantities (such as pressure using hydrostatic equilibrium), this calculation is performed using the *unscaled* density!

  This rotation model defines the rotation of a body from its relative orbit w.r.t. some central body. Specifically:

  * The body-fixed x-axis is *always* pointing towards the central body
  * The body-fixed z-axis is *always* perpendicular to the orbital plane (along the direction of :math:`\mathbf{x}\times\mathbf{v}`)
  * The body-fixed y-axis completes the right-handed reference frame

  This model can be useful for, for instance, approximate rotation of tidally locked natural satellites, or nadir-pointinf spacraft.

  The precession-nutation theory may be :literal:`iau_2000a`, :literal:`iau_2000b` or :literal:`iau_2006`, as implemented in the SOFA toolbox. Alternative options to modify the input (not shown above) include the EOP correction file, input time scale, short period UT1 and polar motion variations.

.. class:: Tabulated Aerodynamic Coefficient

  Settings for tabulated aerodynamic coefficients as a function of given independent variables. These tables can be defined either manually or loaded from a file, as discussed in more detail on the :ref:`aerodynamic_coefficients` page. Coefficients can be defined as a function of angle of sideslip, angle of attack, Mach number or altitude. If you simulation requires any other dependencies for the coefficients, please open an issue on Github requesting feature.

.. class:: Local Inclination Methods
  
  Settings for aerodynamic coefficients computed internally using a shape model of the vehicle, valid for hypersonic Mach numbers. Currently, this type of aerodynamic coefficients can only be set manually in the :literal:`Body` object directly.
